I made this list to avoid redistribution of other creators' assets on GitHub, so before starting a game download all of the following assets in this directory and unpack them.

## Asset list:
1. https://gif-superretroworld.itch.io/interior-pack
2. https://opengameart.org/content/tiny-characters-set
3. https://cheekyinkling.itch.io/shikashis-fantasy-icons-pack
